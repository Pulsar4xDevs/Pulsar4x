ECS FAQ:

What is ECS?
ECS stands for Entity Component System. read:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system
http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html
Since the game has "Components" and "Systems", to avoid confusion we've changed the name of the ECS "Components" to "DataBlobs"
and ECS "Systems" to "Processors"


How do I create an new Entity?
Create a new static class in the Factories folder, see the other Factories in the folder for examples.
Note that the class should be:
public static.
Should take an EntityManager class (though this can in some cases be derived from an Entity).
contain a list of DataBlobs.
Return an Entity.

In most cases you'll be passing in a faction entity.
to create the entity itself, you'll need a list of DataBlobs that make up the entity.
the entity is then created in the following manner: Entity foo = Entity.Create(entityManager, listofDataBlobs);

Note that an entity can have only one DataBlob of a given type

What EntityManager should be used to create an Entity?
That depends on what the entity does and where it operates: 

12:40 <Rod-Serling> Facitons, ShipClasses, Technologies, Species, ComponentDefs
12:40 <Rod-Serling> All stuff that should be on the GlobalManager
12:40 <Rod-Serling> Ships, Populations, Components, those are things that should be on a system manager.
12:41 <Rod-Serling> Ships needs a shipyard entity to spawn at, you're going to be getting the shipyard location, so pass in the shipyard entity and use it's manager.
12:41 <Rod-Serling> Populations, the planet.
12:41 <Rod-Serling> Components, the ship.
12:42 <Rod-Serling> SystemManager is for concrete things
12:42 <Rod-Serling> GlobalManager is for blueprints, prototypes, and ideas.

What About DataBlobs?
A list of DataBlobs makes up an entity.
A DataBlob is a collection of data that will change during the game.
A DataBlob cannot contain another DataBlob.
A DataBlob can contain an Entity, a list, or a dictionary of Entities.
note that when using an dictionary which has a key that is an entity, a JDictionary should be used.
A DataBlob can contain an StaticData object, a list, or dictionary of StaticData objects.
again note that when using a StaticData object as a key in a dictionary, a JDictionary should be used.
Is normally created by a factory when creating an entity.

What is a StaticData object?
A StaticData object is a collection of data that does not change during the game.
A StaticData object is a struct.
Is normally created by a factory when creating DataBlobs for an entity. 

What is a Factory?
A factory is used to create the DataBlobs and StaticData for an entity, and returns an entity.

What is a Processor?
A Processor contains the game logic code and does most the heavy lifting. 
[2015-04-13 12:39:42] <intercross> From where Processor's Process are called?
[2015-04-13 12:40:24] <Rod-Serling> Lines 222-225 in Game.cs
[2015-04-13 12:41:26] <Rod-Serling> To add a processor to that list, add it manually around lines 99-102 of Game.cs

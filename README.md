## Compiling Pulsar4x

To compile Pulsar4x we recommend either [VisualStudio 2013 Community Edition](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx) or Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop, available [here.](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs)
 
Instructions:

1. Clone the Git Repo.

2. Open the solution file "Pulsar4X\Pulsar4X.sln".

3. Build the "Pulsar4X.UI" project. This will automatically build the Pulsar Library (containing the game logic) as well as the UI. You can find the compile program in "Pulsar4X\Pulsar4X.UI\bin\Debug" or "Pulsar4X\Pulsar4X.UI\bin\Release", depending on the build configuration.

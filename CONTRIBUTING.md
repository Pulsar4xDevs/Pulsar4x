# Contribution Guide

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Pulsar 4X. Remember that these are just guidelines and not rules. 

## Bug reports

Bugs are tracked with the GitHub issue tracker.

### How to make a good bug report

#### 1. Add a descriptive title

People should be able to get the gist of what your report is about after reading the title. 
Example:
 - The game crashes when trying to dock multiple ships in the same port
Things to avoid:
 - Asking a question in the title (can't dock multiple ships?)
 - Having a non-descriptive title (game breaking bug)
 - Having a *really* descriptive title (Game crashes when trying to dock multiple ships in Venus colony on 2212 [...])
 
 #### 2. Describe the bug
 
 This is an optional part. Sometimes the intended behaviour is unclear. <br />
 For example, in Aurora, you can form a team on Venus, disband the team and re-form it on Earth, all in one day. <br />
 Is this a bug or a feature? If you can't find it in the [FAQ](https://github.com/Pulsar4xDevs/Pulsar4x/wiki/FAQ), feel free send in a report. <br />
 A good description would be something like this:
  - Inteded behaviour: Teams can't 'teleport' from one planet to another.
  - Actual behaviour: Disbanding and reforming teams, 'teleports' them to another planet.
 
 #### 3. Describe what happened, how it happened
 
 Ideally, anyone reading your bug report should be able to open their game and reproduce the bug just by reading your report. <br />
 We recommend writing a list of the steps you took that lead to the bug. Example:
  1. Created two ships.
  2. Added the movement order to enter Venus shipyard.
  3. The ships arrived and disappeared.
  Don't worry if you think you missed something here, if it's not enough to reproduce the issue we will ask for more information.
  
  #### 4. Include screenshots
  
  If it's appropriate, feel free to add screenshots to your report.
  
  #### 5. Include the log file
  
  Pulsar 4X (unfortunately) doesn't have logging in place (yet). For now, ignore this part.

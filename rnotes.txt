What about possible breakthroughs, or special effects or technology trees that come from research "obsolete" technology trees. For example, despite the fact that glass was considered inferior compared to porcelain, its use and development led to lenses, optics, lasers, modern astronomy, and pretty much our understanding of light. Or what about the opposite. It doesn't have to be that drastic though, could just be a small crossover improvement. Also what about individual scientists, basically citizen scientists or a private sector research, which could do small amounts of research in these obsolete techs and provide occasional breakthroughs. Basically a research cottage industry.
